# Word-Editor

Word Editor is a free Web-based application in which documents can be created, edited (underline, bold, italic and add photos much more)and stored online and you can use all the features available in google docs.
<br />
You can share the document with others and multiple people can edit the same document at same time so for this real time editing I have used socket.io.
The editor is QuillJs its  powerful rich editor. To open new document automatically its get open using UUID package.
